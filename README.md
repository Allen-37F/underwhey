### UnderWhey is a trip planning tool. Whether you're heading to work in the morning or planning a road trip, UnderWhey can make sure you're prepared. Just tell it where you're going!

###Why should I use UnderWhey?

* It's raining at my destination, but it looked clear at my house. I wish I'd checked the weather.
* I had to work from a different office today, and I made it most of the way to the office before I realized I forgot to bring my keycard.
* Brought the dog to the dog park. Did I think to bring poop bags or her favorite toy from under the couch? Nope!
* Bringing babies to dinner parties sucks in general, but it sucks especially when you didn't bring the clean diaper that you specifically set aside and then forgot about.
* Sitting in traffic alone for a half hour in silence, then suddenly remember that you have an audio book that you'd been meaning to finish, or a podcast that you'd been looking forward to. It's happened to all of us.

####UnderWhey can help remind you to bring the things you'll need at your destination, and help make your trip more enjoyable and productive by recommending episodes of your favorite podcasts that match the length of your commute, as well as reminding you to

###UnderWhey can:
* Tell you how long it'll take you to get where you're going in current traffic.
* Check the weather at your destination and suggest things to keep you comfortable.
* Store destination-specific packing lists for your trip.
* Suggest a podcast that matches the length of your commute.
* Keep track of your audio book library, and suggest books for you to continue.
